# Stylish JavaScript Website

[Projects](#projects)

Welcome to my stylish JavaScript website! This website is designed to showcase my skills in web development and JavaScript programming. Here are some of the features you'll find on my website:

![ Stylish JavaScript Website ](/Images/Stylish-JavaScript-website.png)

## Navigation Bar Cool Hover

When you hover over the navigation bar links, you'll see a cool hover effect that adds some visual interest to the design.

## Smooth Scrolling to Different Sections

As you scroll down the page, you'll notice that the sections smoothly and visually transition into view. This creates a seamless browsing experience for users and adds a touch of style to the design.

## Sticky Navigation Bar

As you scroll down the page, the navigation bar will become sticky and remain visible at the top of the screen. This makes it easy for users to navigate through the site, even on long pages.

## Section Transition Lazy Load

To improve performance and reduce load times, my website uses section transition lazy load for both the sections and internal images. This means that sections and images are loaded only when they are needed, resulting in faster load times and a better user experience.

I hope you enjoy exploring my website and seeing what I can do with JavaScript and web development. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out!

# Dice Rolling Game

[Projects](#projects)

Welcome to the Dice Rolling Game! This is a JavaScript game where the goal is to reach a score of 100 as fast as possible. The game is played by two players, and each player takes turns rolling a dice and accumulating points.

![ Dice Rolling Game ](/Images/Dice-Rolling-Game.png)

## How to Play

1. The first player clicks on the "Roll Dice" button to roll a dice and get a value from 1 to 6.
2. The value of the dice roll is added to the player's turn score.
3. The player can choose to either "Hold" their turn, which adds their turn score to their total score and ends their turn, or they can choose to "Roll Dice" again.
4. If the player chooses to "Roll Dice" again, and they roll a value less than what they rolled in their previous turn, they lose their turn and their turn score is reset to 0.
5. The turn then passes to the second player, who repeats steps 1-4.
6. The game continues until one player reaches a total score of 100.
7. At the end of the game, each player must get the exact remaining score to achieve 100 points. If a player's turn score plus their total score becomes more than 100, they will lose their turn and their turn score will be reset to 0.

## How to Win

The winner of the game is the first player to reach a total score of 100 or more, while also ensuring that their total score does not exceed 100 points.

I hope you enjoy playing this game and testing your luck with the dice rolls! Have fun and good luck!
